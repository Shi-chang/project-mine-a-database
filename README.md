# Overview
In this project, our team has loaded a XML document(contains information about journal publications), created and realized the schema, populated the tables in the database with data extracted from the XML document. We have also created and populated a start schema and a summary fact table. Finally, we explored the established data warehouse to analyze publication patterns.

# What I have learned
Creat relational schema, load and parse XML file and populat tables in MySQL with RStudio.
Creat and populate the star schema with dimension and transaction fact tables and a summary fact table.
Write queries on data warehouse to analyze the patterns of the publications, and visualize results.

# My contribution to the project
1. Revised and reviewed the relational schema.
2. Loaded and parsed the XML file and populated the database.

4. Completed a query on the summary fact table to analyze the top authors having the most publications.
